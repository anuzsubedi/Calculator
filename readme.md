# Calculator App

This is a simple calculator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can view the live preview of the app [here](https://anuzsubedi.github.io/calculator-css/).

## Inspiration

I drew inspiration from the [Retro Calculator](https://peerlist.io/jisan/project/retro-calculator) project on Peerlist.io. The goal was to replicate the retro aesthetic and functionality using a combination of modern web technologies.
